# FifaWorldCup2018

1. Run the program and get live notifications for every few seconds
2. The issues that can possibly happen are addressed in comment section below the program. i.e If you try the run the program and get the score of another match rather than world cup then manually open the given 'url' and check at which index is present. This happnes because there is no reliable rss feed for fifa as of now. 
3. So if the issue persists or you want me to solve it, then feel free to contact me.
